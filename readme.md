# What's John Drinking?

I got sick of the [Untappd](https://untappd.com/) UI, so I built my own site to track the beer I've been drinking.

This little site currently shows the feed of beers I've checked into Untappd, my top 10 rated beers, and some relatively simple visualizations about my drinking habits. I hope to add more categories in the future.

There's more to come, so stay tuned!
